## License

MIT License - see LICENSE file for details

## Security

- Never commit your `.env` file or GitHub tokens to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate your GitHub Personal Access Tokens
- Ensure your GitHub token has minimal required permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GitHub token not configured"**: Make sure your `.env` file contains a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN`
2. **"No private repositories found"**: Ensure your token has `repo` scope and access to private repositories
3. **API rate limits**: GitHub API has rate limits; the app handles this gracefully but may need retries for heavy usage

### Support

If you encounter issues, please check:
1. Your GitHub token is valid and has the correct permissions
2. You have access to the private repositories you're trying to monitor
3. Your internet connection is stable for GitHub API calls
